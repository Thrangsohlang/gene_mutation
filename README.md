# Gene Mutation
This repository focuses on gene mutation classification using feature encoding and machine learning algorithms. It includes Jupyter notebooks for training the models, pre-trained model files, and a Streamlit app that connects to a MongoDB database for making predictions.

## Features
* **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning algorithms are applied to classify gene mutations.
* **Feature Encoding:** The data is pre-processed and encoded for model training. NLTK and Feature Encoding is used for this process.
* **Streamlit Interface:** A user-friendly Streamlit application to input values and get predictions.
* **MongoDB Integration:** The Streamlit app connects to a MongoDB database to fetch and predict mutation classes.

## Testing
1. Change the directory to test and run the following commands:
```bash
streamlit run StreamlitApp.py
```
2. Input the values then predict the class of the mutation.
